      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my digital corner! Inspired by the wild days of crafting personal pages on Geocities, I embarked on
        a late-career shift into web development. Being self-taught in this ever-evolving field is a constant struggle,
        a journey marked by the perpetual challenge of figuring out how to do something and wrestling with the internal
        battle to stay focused and find the elusive flow.</p>
      <p>My approach to web development is grounded in the raw reality of this struggle. Every line of code is a triumph
        over obstacles, an incremental step in the ongoing journey from Geocities to the complex and dynamic world of
        web development. Despite the challenges, the thrill of turning ideas into digital realities and creating
        user-friendly online experiences keeps me fueled and focused.</p>
      <p>Join me in navigating the trials and triumphs of this self-taught journey, where each struggle becomes a
        stepping stone to innovation. Let's build something extraordinary together.</p>
